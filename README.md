The original lava lamp was invented in 1963 by British entrepreneur Edward Craven Walker. Known initially as the "Astro Lamp," it quickly gained popularity for its unique and mesmerizing visual effects. The design featured a cylindrical glass container filled with a special liquid and blobs of colored wax. When heated by an incandescent light bulb at the base, the wax would melt and rise and fall within the liquid, creating a continuously changing and captivating display. This hypnotic motion and the colorful, soft glow of the lamp made it a popular decorative item during the 1960s and 1970s, particularly appealing to the counterculture and psychedelic movements of the time.

The original lava lamp design was characterized by its simple yet innovative use of materials and principles of thermodynamics. The combination of the glass cylinder, metallic base, and cap, along with the proprietary wax and liquid formula, created a product that was both aesthetically pleasing and functionally intriguing. The lamp's ability to transform any room with its calming light and dynamic motion made it a beloved item in homes, offices, and dorm rooms. Over the years, the lava lamp has remained an iconic symbol of mid-20th-century design and continues to be a popular novelty item, evoking a sense of nostalgia and timeless appeal.

#### Modern Lava Lamp Concept

The modern square-sided lava lamp concept features a sleek and contemporary design that diverges from the traditional cylindrical shape commonly associated with classic lava lamps. The lamp's body is composed of a geometric, square-sided glass enclosure, which gives it a striking and sophisticated appearance. The sharp, clean lines of the square design enhance its modern aesthetic, making it an ideal addition to minimalist and contemporary interior decor.

Inside the lamp, the vibrant, colorful wax flows smoothly, creating mesmerizing patterns and dynamic shapes. The wax glows with a warm, reddish-orange hue, contrasting beautifully against the cooler blue tones of the glass enclosure. This interplay of colors adds a visually captivating element to the lamp, drawing the eye and creating a soothing, ambient light effect. The overall design is both functional and artistic, combining the nostalgic appeal of a lava lamp with a cutting-edge, modern twist. The lamp stands on a solid, black base, ensuring stability and further accentuating its sleek, modern look.

#### Decorative Lava Lamp - US6604835B2

Patent US6604835B2, titled "Decorative Lava Lamp," was granted to Stanley Zale and assigned to Louis Glick Diamond Corp. This patent describes a decorative lava lamp featuring dense fluids and discrete granules such as diamonds or other precious gems. The lamp is designed with an electric light source at its base to illuminate and heat the fluid, causing the granules to rise and fall, creating a dynamic and sparkling visual effect. The combination of fluid motion and sparkling gems adds a unique decorative dimension to the traditional lava lamp.

The invention involves a transparent or translucent housing filled with dense immiscible fluids, like silicone oil, and gem granules. The heating element in the lamp base generates convection currents, moving the granules within the fluid. This movement, combined with the internal lighting, results in a mesmerizing light show. The use of valuable materials like diamonds enhances the visual appeal and sets this design apart from typical lava lamps.

Despite its innovative design, patent US6604835B2 is currently expired due to non-payment of maintenance fees. Utility patents typically last for 20 years from the filing date, subject to the timely payment of maintenance fees. The original filing date of this patent was September 4, 2001. The patent expired before its full term, indicating that the required fees were not paid to keep it active.

#### Color Changing Lighting Device - US20080239705A1

Patent US20080239705A1, titled "Color Changing Lighting Device," was filed by inventors Yan X. Lin and Thomas M. Spain. This patent application describes a lighting device comprising a base and a diffuser containing liquid globules. The device features a heating system to move the globules and a lighting system capable of changing colors, providing a dynamic and colorful display. The LEDs in the lighting system allow for the colors to change, enhancing the visual effect of the rising and falling liquid globules.

The lighting device aims to improve upon traditional novelty lights by incorporating color-changing capabilities through the use of LEDs. The patent details the construction, including a heat shield to protect the LEDs from the heat generated by the heating element. This ensures that the LEDs can function effectively without being damaged by heat, thereby maintaining the integrity of the color-changing feature.

This patent application is also currently expired due to non-payment of maintenance fees, with an adjusted expiration date of April 9, 2028. Patent applications that are granted become utility patents, which have a lifespan of 20 years from the filing date if all maintenance fees are paid. The filing date for this application was March 28, 2008. The expiration due to fee-related issues indicates that the maintenance fees were not paid to keep the patent active for its full term.
